# Classes and Business Logic Implementation

## Objectifs

- **Implement the Classes**: Develop the classes as per your UML diagram, ensuring each class has the necessary attributes and methods.
- **Apply Business Logic**: Implement the business rules that were outlined, such as unique user identification, one host per place, and review systems.
- **Test Functionality**: Write unit tests to verify that your classes and business logic are working as expected.


## Instructions

1- **Translate UML Diagrams into Code**:
- Create a different package for each layer, i.e. API, Model, Persistence.
- Start by creating Python classes for each entity (User, Place, Review, etc.) as defined in your UML diagram.
- Add attributes and methods to each class. Ensure they match what was outlined in your design.
- Establish relationships as per your UML design. For example, implement the one-to-many relationship between users and places, or the many-to-many relationship between places and amenities.
