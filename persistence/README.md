##Persistence Implementation##

This task involves designing a flexible data management system that leverages best practices in software development. The focus will be on creating an interface or abstract class, which the DataManager class will implement. This approach not only simplifies initial development but also adheres to best practices by allowing for easy extension and modification of the persistence mechanism.

##Objectives

. Develop an interface-based persistence layer that supports easy modification and extension.
. Implement a unified DataManager class that adheres to the defined interface, capable of handling CRUD operations across different entity types.
. Maintain flexibility to transition between different storage mechanisms in the future, such as file-based storage and databases.

##Requirements

- Persistence Interface: Define an interface that standardizes CRUD operations for data management.
- DataManager Implementation: Implement this interface in a DataManager class that handles data persistence across various entity types.
- Extensibility and Flexibility: Ensure that the system is designed to easily incorporate changes to the data storage approach.

##Instructions

STEP 1: Define the Data Management Interface
1. Create a Persistence Interface:
	- Define an abstract class or interface, IPersistenceManager, that outlines methods for saving, retrieving, updating, and deleting entities.
	- Include method signatures that are generic enough to handle various data types but structured to enforce consistency in data handling.


Example Interface (Python-style pseudo-code)

'''pyton
   from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

   class IPersistenceManager(ABC):
       @abstractmethod
       def save(self, entity):
           pass

       @abstractmethod
       def get(self, entity_id, entity_type):
           pass

       @abstractmethod
       def update(self, entity):
           pass

       @abstractmethod
       def delete(self, entity_id, entity_type):
           pass
